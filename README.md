Write a program that dynamically allocates space for three arrays of integers t1, t2, and t3, according
to a size provided by the user.
1- Use the array t1 to place integer values also entered by the user.
2- The array t2 is intended to receive the squares of the numbers contained in t1,
3- Display the values of the array t2 using the for-each loop,
4- Fill the array t3 with random values between 5 and 99 (using the Math class)
5- Sort the elements of t3 in ascending order (using an existing method, see the Arrays class),
6- Display the values of the array t3 using the for-each loop.
7- Display the maximum and minimum values of t3 using existing functions from the Arrays class.
In case the user enters a negative size, the program must prompt them to enter a new positive size
